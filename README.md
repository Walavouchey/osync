# osync

[osu! lazer](https://www.github.com/ppy/osu) beatmap exporter

Exports beatmaps you have in lazer that aren't in stable.

Edit the `config.cfg` file in notepad and fill in the three self-explanatory parameters. After compiling, whenever you want to export your maps, run `./bin/osync.exe`. After nothing exploded, copy the files to your Songs folder and hit F5 in stable.

# TODO

- Export as .osz files instead
